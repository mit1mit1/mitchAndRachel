		<div class="question">How do I get there?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				There's a whole bunch of people going from Sydney, so we'd encourage you to reach out to
				each other and carpool.
			</div>
			<div>
				There's also a train that can get you <i>somewhat</i> close.
			</div>
			<div>
				Note that the bus <b>doesn't</b> run on weekends, so let us know if you're taking that route
				and we can organize for you to be picked up from the station.
			</div>

		<div class="question">Do I need to stay nearby?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				We're starting the wedding a little before midday, and formalities will all be finished by
				5pm, so it should be pretty easy to do a day trip from Sydney.
			</div>
			<div>
				However if you want to stay nearby there's a few AirBnBs in the immediate vicinity and a
				bunch of hotels scattered throughout the mountains.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="centeredDivider">-----</div>
		<div class="question">What the heck is an informal dinner?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				Since we know a few people will be staying nearby, and there's not much in the way of
				restaurants in Bilpin, we're providing a chill dinner at the property for anyone who feels
				like sticking around.
			</div>
			<div>
				You're very welcome to join us for this, but please don't feel any pressure to - all the
				exciting parts of the day will be finished up before this.
			</div>

		<div class="question">Will the registry have more than three things added to it?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>Maybe - check back later to see I guess?</div>

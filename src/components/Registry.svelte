		Your presence is all that is required! However, if you want to give something, we have three options:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.givedirectly.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">givedirectly.org</a
				> - we're very well off, and it would mean more to us that you have money to people who need it than if you gave it to us that don't;
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
					>againstmalaria.com</a
				>; - same vibe;
			</li>
			<li>or send us money for a honeymoon.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>Feel free to let me know - or not! Again, we'll of course just be happy to have you there regardless.</div>
